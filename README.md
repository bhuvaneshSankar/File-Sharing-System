# File-Sharing-System
Project i have done when i was working as summer intern in zoho corporation.
This webapp runs on apache tomcat server.
It is built using bootstrap, jsp, servlets.
When user logs in his default workspace with his directories and files are displayed.
User can edit files and save it.
User can share files to other users with read/write protection.
All the logs of the files are saved and can be viewed.
Shared file logs also can be viewed by both sender and the receiver.
